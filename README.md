Vaadin on Heroku
================

This project is to demonstrate how to easily build a small Vaadin application to be deployed on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com).

It is very largely inspired by [this blog post](http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/8/25/java/), the only difference being that instead of starting a simple Jetty, it uses
[Embed for Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/directory#addon/embed-for-vaadin) to quickly start an easily configured embedded tomcat.

This application is deployed on heroku and accessible at http://electric-meadow-7573.herokuapp.com
